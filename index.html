                <h3>Fun facts about otters</h3>
                <img src="image/LutrasGul.jpg" alt="Otters sleep" style="width: 100%">
                <ol>
                    <li>Thirteen different species of otter exist all around the world. Some are small river otters, and some are bigger sea otters.</li>
                    <li>90% of all sea otters live on the coast of Alaska.</li>
                    <li>They're hungry animals! Sea otters eat 25% of their body weight in food every day.</li>
                    <li>Clever creatures, they'll use rocks to crack open the clams. They carry rocks and store food in the loose skin under their armpits - who needs carrier bags!</li>
                    <li>Baby otters are called pups. Newborn pups need lots of attention, and will stay close to their mum's until they've developed enough skills to go it alone - usually at 6 months.</li>
                    <li>An otter pup's fur is too dense for it to swim underwater. So, their mother leaves them floating while she searches for food, until their adult fur grows in.</li>
                    <li>Don't challenge an otter to a holding-your-breath competition! Sea otters can stay underwater for 5 minutes, and river otters can hold their breath for even longer - 8 minutes!</li>
                    <li>Otters like to stick together, so when they sleep they will wrap themselves in seaweed and float together in a group. A group of resting otters is called a raft. We wouldn't go drifting away on one of these rafts, however! Otters have a nasty bite!</li>
                </ol>
